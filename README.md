# AI-Assisted Medical Image Analysis System: Pneumonia Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on the development of an AI-assisted medical image analysis system to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images using deep learning techniques. The application is built with **Flask** for web development and utilizes a pre-trained model based on **EfficientNet** architecture for pneumonia detection.

## Features

- Upload chest X-ray images for pneumonia detection.
- AI model provides predictions of whether the image shows **Pneumonia** or is **Normal**.
- Easy-to-use web interface for uploading images.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask (Python Web Framework)
- **Model**: TensorFlow, Keras (EfficientNet for pneumonia detection)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Custom file upload and form submission)
- **Environment**: Python 3.x, Virtual Environment (venv)
- **Cloud Hosting**: Vultr (for deploying the Flask web app)

## Setup

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- Flask
- Gunicorn (for production environment)
- Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

### Install Dependencies

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repo_url>
    cd <project_directory>
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Flask app:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4. You can now access the web app at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` on your local machine.

## Demo

You can check out the live demo of the application here:  
[http://139.84.218.53](http://139.84.218.53)

*Note: After uploading the Chest X-Ray image you might not be able to see on the web app, it will be uploaded and you can click on Upload and Analyze button to see the prediction.

## How to Use

1. **Upload Image**: Click on the "Choose Image" button and select a chest X-ray image from your local machine.
2. **Analyze Image**: Click on "Upload and Analyze" to upload the image for analysis.
3. The model will predict whether the image shows **Pneumonia** or is **Normal** and display the result.
